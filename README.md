# RunR (Rom Runner)

This web app bundles [emulatorjs](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS) and [libretrojs](https://github.com/linuxserver/libretrojs) inside a simple container to allow management systems like [RomM](https://github.com/zurdi15/romm) to play retro games without implementing all of its dependencies.

This project is powered by [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

## How to use it

Playing a game:

``` 
<url>/?rom=library/nes/game.zip&core=nes&type=emu
```

Forcing libretro:
 
```
<url>/?rom=library/nes/game.zip&core=fceumm&type=libretro
```


For example if you deploy it in the `3000` port: 
``` 
http://localhost:3000/?rom=library/nes/game.zip&core=nes&type=emu
```

### Available Query Parameters

The system allows for several extra parameters to allow better customization:

- `type`: Sets the type of the runtime to execute the rom (emu || libretro). Optional if DEFAULT_RUNTIME is configured.
- `rom`: Sets the path to the rom file (required)
- `platform`: Specifies the platform to emulate (optional). System will try to identify this based on the rom path.
- `core`: Sets the core needed to load the game. See bellow for more information. The system will try to identify this automatically
- `bios`: Sets the path to the bios file (optional)


## Roadmap

Features pending to be implemented:
- [x] Execute roms with EmulatorJS
- [x] Execute roms with LibretroJS
- [x] Automatically detect platform based on rom path
- [x] Automatically translate cores based on platforms
- [ ] Fully integrate with RomM
- [x] Partial RomM integration via Bookmarklet. See #
- [ ] Automatically resolve bios files if required. Based on configurations
- [ ] Automatically resolve platform compatibility to choose best emulation type
- [ ] Implement official libretro instead of linuxserver's
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Create testing environment
- [ ] Implement threaded cores
- [ ] Explore emulatorjs additional parameters (ej: nes lightgun)

Nice to have in the future:
- [ ] Handle sessions across different browsers?
- [ ] Netplay? Maybe? ðŸ˜…
- [ ] Check if [Nostalgist.js](https://github.com/arianrhodsandlot/nostalgist) can fit as executor

## Emulator Runners

The system uses two different emulator runners:

- [EmulatorJS](https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS)

For this we currently use the latest version as it is by wrapping the execution of it with the parameters received.

> RunnR actually supports specifing the bios and core parameters mentioned before. We plan to add extra parameters like NES ligthgun in future releases.


Check EmulatorJS docs for more information: [https://github.com/EmulatorJS/EmulatorJS/tree/main/docs]


- [LibretroJS](https://github.com/linuxserver/libretrojs)

This implementation is a bit tricky as its a linuxserver custom wrapper with its own cores. This is currently used in the linuxserver/emulatorjs project and they released the cores and the library separately.

For this we made a couple of modifications to align with the EmulatorJS implementation by changing from where it can load the resources.

Here the implementation of this project is better than ours as they have its own filebrowser to load allow users to save localStorage sessions for later with authentication and so, but well... this is our first version ðŸ˜…

## Compatibility and Requirements

WIP

- 3d0: BIOS required
- Colecovision: Only Libretro. BIOS required
- msx: Only Libretro. BIOS required
- odyssey2: Only Libretro. BIOS required
- PSX: Only Libretro
- vectrex: Only Libretro

## RomM Integration

One of the goals of this project is to be able to play [RomM](https://github.com/zurdi15/romm) games in my personal library directly. 

Instead of including all of this implementation in the `RomM` codebase i've decided to extract and package this system as a separate container.

This maybe allows other systems to integrate it ass well and improves the delivery of both projects as they wont depend on each other.

> Disclaimer: I don't have any relationship with the developers of `RomM` and this is just a personal project that i've created in my spare time.

### How to configure `RomM`:

There is an open PR sent to the team to include the code required to run the games directly.

To use it you need to configure several things:

- RomM envinronment variables:
``` yaml
    ...
    - RUNR_ENABLED: true
    - RUNR_URL: http://localhost:3000/ # The final slash(/) is important
```

- RunR library: The location of the library must match with the one configured in RomM. Example:
``` yaml

  romm:
    ...
    volumes:
      - /data/Roms:/romm/library
    ...
  runr:
    ...
    environment: 
      - LIBRARY_PATH: /library
    volumes:
      - /data/Roms:/library
    ...

```

# Installation

System is packaged as a docker container inside Github registry. For installing it the recommended method is using a `docker-compose` file like this:

```yaml
WIP
```

## Environment variables available

``` yaml
BASE_PATH: undefined # Only set this if the proyect files will be loaded from a different folder than default
RELATIVE_PATH: undefined # Only set this if the deployment is done in a proxied subpath of another domain name.
LIBRARY_PATH: /library # Path where system will use to search for roms.
USE_THREADED: false # If the emulators should prefer threaded versions of the cores. This will improve systems like the NDS but requires to be deployed using https
DEFAULT_RUNTIME: emu || libretro # Default runtime to be used. Ifnot specified the redirection should have a type parameter.
[WIP]
```

# Development Setup

```bash
bun install
```
